README [walking_rev7]

This is the true implementation of micro-fluidic 'Walkameter'. 

1. The channel inlet from 'Syringe Pump 9' to 'Flowcell Inlet' was changed to 200 mm and the 'channel_volume' is set to zero, since we neglect the fluid volume from actual PDMS channel inlet to chamber. 
2. The reaction chamber volume, i.e., the 'flowcell_volume' is set to 10 uL, but depends on the design (can be 5 or 10 uL).
